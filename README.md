Librario
--------------------

Librario is a web application for those book lovers who have so many books they don't have any more room on their shelves. This application helps you keep a list of all the books you own. So the next time your in the book store and you can't remember if you've already bought a book you can just pull up your Librario list! In a future version I would like to add a social aspect to the application and allow a user to share their collection with their friends.
